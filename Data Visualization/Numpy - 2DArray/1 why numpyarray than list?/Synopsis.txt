IMage desciption:

in coding screenshot, we are comparing list vs numpyarray memory consumption/usage in RAM 
To compare that we need to calculate total memory allocation in RAM in bytes

print(sys.getsizeof(5) * len(l))
here, multiplying memory size of each element with total length of that list. it will find the total bytes occupied

print(array.itemsize * array.size)
same here also multiplying each element(item) size with the total length of the array(array.size)

list occupies more space than numpy array.




in the 2nd coding eg. we are adding two lengthy list vs numpyarray to check which is fast in code execution:

in smaller input both executed in 0.0. millisecond, but to add millions of numbers, numpyarray wins.
